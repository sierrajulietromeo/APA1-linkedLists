# APA1 Linked Lists Project

## Overview
This project explores the implementation and applications of linked list data structures, demonstrating both procedural and object-oriented programming approaches.

## Features
- Custom linked list implementation
- Various methods for list manipulation
- Performance comparison with arrays
- Practical use cases demonstration
- Both procedural and OOP implementations

## Key Implementations
- Basic linked list structure
- Insertion and deletion methods
- Browser history simulator
- Music playlist manager

## Implementation Styles

### Procedural Implementation
`linkedListProceduralExample101.js` demonstrates a linked list using a procedural programming style, with functions for creating and displaying a list of numbers.

### Object-Oriented Implementation
`linkedListOopExample101.js` provides an OOP implementation with `Node` and `LinkedList` classes to encapsulate the data structure and its operations.

## Performance Testing
- `1-linkedListFrontInsertion.js` - Tests for inserting (or deleting) from the front of a list
- `2-linkedListRandomInsertion.js` - Tests for inserting (or deleting) from a random position in the list

## Practical Applications
- `browserHistorySimulator.js` - Backend code for a browser history simulator
- `musicPlaylist.js` - Backend code for a music playlist
